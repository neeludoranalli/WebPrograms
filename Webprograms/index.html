               <center> <p style="font-size: 18px;width:70%;">The State Town Planning Department had recommended looking into a mass rapid transit project, i.e. a metro for Bangalore city way back in 1977. A high-level Committee had also agreed that a metro study was warranted and a team from Southern Railway (SR) was commissioned to do this in 1981. The Southern Railway team recommended a 2-corridor metro, 24 km in length in addition to commuter rail lines and a ring railway.
            
                    In 1993, the State of Karnataka established another committee to look into mass rapid transit. This committee had again recommended the same metro project put forward by SR in 1983 and the same circular railway.
